When getting new data from labelbox, save in /PARSE DATA/ and run 'python3.8 parse_labelbox.py --json_file <json_file>'.
Then, drag the new 'triplet_data.csv' into /Data/ and delete the old 'triplet_data.csv'

To run experiments, use /experiments/run_experiments.py and change the code


TODO:
- compute BoW vectors for data to reduce run time 
- fix NaNs (do not occur when unsupervised; beta=0)
- Add gradient tracking to wandb
    -  check to see which gradient produces NaNs
        - add weight decay to the gradient (same order as LR)
- get csv file with all amazon reviews used for traning

Long term TODO:
- trade off graphs (with topic tables)
- start plotting thetas (topic/word distributions)
-
